# Election And Financial Analysis
Python Coding, Author: Henry Le, Feb. 2020

## PyElections
In this project, I developed the codes to help the city of Houston modernize its vote-counting process for the next mayoral elections. Main taks is to write a script to find only the two candidates with the highest number of votes, who will advance to the runoff election. 

Source codes: in file name: "main.py"

Upon running the program, these results will show:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* Print the names of the two candidates who will advance to the runoff election
* A text file contained results will only be exported, named: "Houston_Mayoral_Election_Results.txt"
